    - undirected complete graph
        - if not complete, add arbitrarily large edges to complete
    - good starting point for our implementations

Approximation
    Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms

    source code, blog posts, research papers, etc. exist for this technique
    
    easy enough to implement, pretty cool technique
    
    Things to test:
        1. use all cores to run alternate routes (each seeds RNG to decide paths differently)
            - all cores use the same pheromone graph
        2. split cores into groups, where each group uses a different initial seed
            - 64 cores -> 8 groups of 8 cores, each group has its own pheromone graph
            - at the end (after some termination condition), allreduce the best paths
