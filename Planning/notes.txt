    - undirected complete graph
        - if not complete, add arbitrarily large edges to complete
    - good starting point for our implementations

Approximation
    Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms
    source code, blog posts, research papers, etc. exist for this technique
    
    easy enough to implement, pretty cool technique
    
    Things to test:
        1. use all cores to run alternate routes (each seeds RNG to decide paths differently)
            - all cores use the same pheromone graph
        2. split cores into groups, where each group uses a different initial seed
            - 64 cores -> 8 groups of 8 cores, each group has its own pheromone graph
            - at the end (after some termination condition), allreduce the best paths
        
    Algorithm/Implementation ToDo:
        1. setup
            1. parse input
            
                label, x, y
            
                1 565.0 575.0
                2 25.0 185.0
                3 345.0 750.0
                4 945.0 685.0
                
                into...
                
                adjacency matrix ([i][j] is distance(node i, node j))
                
            2. precalculate inverse distances
            3. initialize pheromone graph (same structure as adjacency matrix)
            4. broadcast initial conditions to workers
            
        2. each worker performs an iteration
            1. start at a [random?] node
            2. choose destination (unvisited) based on formulas
            3. deposit pheromone (either on each edge traversal or upon completing a short tour)
            
        3. update the global pheromone trail
            1. send to rank 0, rank 0 combines pheromone maps and broadcasts?
            1. all reduce (sum) pheromone trails and apply decay?
            
        4. goto 2 unless result is good enough
