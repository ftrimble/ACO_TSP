\section{Background}

\subsection{The Travelling Salesman Problem}

The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is an extensively-studied NP-hard problem 
in theoretical computer science with varied applications throughout delivery, 
transportation, planning, and logistic operations. In the formulation of the 
problem, a list of cities is given and the distances between each pair of cities
is known. The question is then: what is the shortest possible path from city to
city that visits each city exactly once? In particular, we studied the symmetric
travelling talesman problem, where the distance from any city A to any city B
is the same as the distance from city B to city A. In this case, the problem
can be modeled as an undirected graph, with vertices representing cities and
edges representing paths between cities.\\

Checking each possible solution to the TSP takes on the order of $O(n!)$ time. 
Other exact algorithms (algorithms which provably return the optimal solution) 
have been devised that operate in $O(n^22^n)$ time. For large cases of the TSP, 
these large runtimes are prohibitively expensive even on supercomputer-class 
machines. Because of this, a large number of approximation algorithms have been 
formulated that are able to quickly approach the optimal solution, some provably
within a certain threshold or with a high probability of being particularly
close to the optimal solution.\\



\subsection{The Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm}

The Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for the travelling salesman problem is one
such approximation algorithm which lends itself well to parallel computation.
The inspiration for this technique comes from the natural world, where ants in a
colony wander seemingly aimlessly until they come across food, at which point
they leave a trail of pheromones for other ants to detect and follow. Pheromones
evaporate over time, so shorter paths accumulate pheromones in a higher density 
more reliably than longer paths. An emergent property of this behavior is that 
efficient paths to food sources will become apparent as more ants wander and 
follow these trails over time.\\

Just as these ants are able to find efficient routes to their food sources by
utilizing this emergent behavior, computers are able to find short paths through
graphs for the TSP by simulating ants and their pheromone trails.
